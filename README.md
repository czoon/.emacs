# Czoon's .emacs

This is my personal configuration file for Emacs, which it's coded to install all by himself the required plugins from Melpa, along with **package** itself. 

## Installation guide

 - Clone the repository into your home directory.
 - Move the .emacs file outside the created folder, so it's directly into your home directory, i.e. **/home/john/.emacs**.
